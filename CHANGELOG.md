## Notable Changes

1. **All deprecated APIs removed.** Please ensure your code builds on
   version 0.95.0 with no deprecation warnings before upgrading!

# 0.95.0 (2018-09-27)

## Fixes

1. `x-www-form-urlencoded` encoding and decoding should be 100%
   spec compliant now, previously the `+` character was not decoded as
   0x20 space. https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/pull/291

2. `scope` no longer sent during token refresh (was redundant)
    https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/pull/301

# 0.93.0 (2018-06-26)

## Notable Changes

1. Implements OpenID Connect (ID Token handling) and the OpenID Connect
   RP Certification test suite.
   https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/pull/101

2. The `OIDAuthorizationUICoordinator` pattern was genericized to
   support non-authorization external user-agent flows like logout
   (though none are directly implemented by AppAuth, yet). 
   `OIDAuthorizationUICoordinator*` classes renamed to
   `OIDExternalUserAgent*`.
   https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/pull/196
   https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/pull/212
   See [Upgrading to 0.93.0](#upgrading-to-0930).

3. Added custom browser support on iOS. Provides several 
   convenience implementations of alternative external user-agents on
   iOS such as Chrome and Firefox. These are intended for
   **enterprise use only**, where the app developers have greater
   control over the operating environment and have special requirements
   that require a custom browser like Chrome.
   See the [code example](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/issues/200#issuecomment-364610027).
   https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/issues/200

## Upgrading to 0.93.0

0.93.0 deprecates several methods. To update your code to avoid the
deprecated methods (which will be required for the 1.0.0 release),
you will need to make changes.

If you implemented your own `OIDAuthorizationUICoordinator`, or called
the methods which accepted a `UICoordinator` instance, you will need to
update to the new method names. See the deprecation error messages
for the new methods to use in those cases.

Most users who are using the convenience methods of AppAuth will only
need to make the following 3 minor changes to their AppDelegate:

### Import:

Change
```objc
@protocol OIDAuthorizationFlowSession;	
```
to
```objc
@protocol OIDExternalUserAgentSession;
```

### Property:

Change
```objc
@property(nonatomic, strong, nullable) id<OIDAuthorizationFlowSession> currentAuthorizationFlow;	
```
to
```objc
@property(nonatomic, strong, nullable) id<OIDExternalUserAgentSession>currentAuthorizationFlow;
```

###  Implementation of `-(BOOL)application:openURL:options:`
Change
```objc
if ([_currentAuthorizationFlow resumeAuthorizationFlowWithURL:url]) {	
```
to
```objc
if ([_currentAuthorizationFlow resumeExternalUserAgentFlowWithURL:url]) {
```
